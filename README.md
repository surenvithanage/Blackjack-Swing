The rules are simple, the player places a bet and then receives a set of cards from the dealer (from a  standard 52 card deck) until they bust by exceeding the limit of 21. The final score is the sum of the  cards prior to the final card that caused the bust.    The house then deals on their own behalf against the player .. Highest score wins! A draw is a no  contest and the bet is returned to the player.
